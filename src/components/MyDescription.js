            Front end developer with a passion for learning. My skill set is built
            on a solid foundation of data structures and algorithms. I focus on making 
            modular, clean code that is both scalable and readable. I have taken
            academic computer science classes at Oregon State University and
            have my associate programmer certification in Java 8.

            While more of my experience is in front end, I also have experience with 
            Node.js and Java Spring backend development.
